    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My interest in technology began in childhood. My father was always curious about new innovations, and he bought a computer at a time when most people in our area had never even seen one. The first machine I used was an Intel Pentium 3, and from the moment I touched it, I was hooked.
    </p>
    <p>At first, it was just videos and games. But when something went wrong ‚Äî and it often did ‚Äî there was no technician to call and no budget to hire help. So I learned. I changed operating systems using CDs, installed drivers manually, opened up the PC to clean the RAM, fixed hardware issues, and got comfortable working with motherboards and internal components. What started as necessity turned into skill ‚Äî and eventually, into a passion.
    </p>
    <p>Over time, I became the go-to ‚Äútech guy‚Äù for friends and family. Fixing computers wasn‚Äôt just something I could do ‚Äî it was something I genuinely enjoyed.
    </p>
    <p>My interest in networking sparked later during a computer class where I learned to build a LAN. The idea of connecting computers, sharing files across machines, and building small-scale networks fascinated me. Since then, I‚Äôve been working toward becoming a Network Architect and Cybersecurity Expert, with a focus on designing secure infrastructures and stopping threats before they start.
    </p>
    <p>I love solving problems, especially when they have real impact. I'm practical, a little lazy when it comes to repetitive tasks ‚Äî which is why I automate them ‚Äî and fully committed when it comes to meaningful work, especially the kind that keeps systems safe and secure.
    </p>
    <p>After 8th grade, I stepped away from tech when I chose biology in hopes of becoming a doctor, following a path my family supported. That led to four years away from computers ‚Äî and eventually to Germany, where I was accepted to study Human Medicine at the University of Marburg. But the complexity of medical German and my growing doubt about the field made me realize something important: I had lost touch with what I actually loved.
    </p>
    <p>In 2022, I made a U-turn. I enrolled in the Pre-College Informatik program at Fulda and returned to what always felt natural ‚Äî computer science. Coming back after a long gap wasn‚Äôt easy. The field had evolved, and I felt behind. But I‚Äôve been catching up quickly, learning modern tools, building real projects, and reigniting the curiosity that started with that old Pentium 3.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, I‚Äôm on a mission to build secure, intelligent systems that make a difference ‚Äî and to become the kind of engineer I always wanted to be.
